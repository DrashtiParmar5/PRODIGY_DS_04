# 💬 Sentiment Analysis on Social Media Data — Task 4 (Internship Project)

## 📌 Task Overview

**Task 4 – Sentiment Analysis & Visualization**  
As part of my internship, I was assigned the task of analyzing and visualizing sentiment trends in real-world social media data to uncover public opinions and attitudes towards different brands or topics.

## 📁 Dataset Description

The dataset used includes tweets from two sources:  
- [`twitter_training.csv`](./twitter_training.csv) – [Click to Download](./twitter_training.csv)  
- [`twitter_validation.csv`](./twitter_validation.csv) – [Click to Download](./twitter_validation.csv)

Each record contains:
- `Tweet_ID`: Unique identifier for the tweet
- `Entity`: Brand or topic mentioned (e.g., Microsoft, Borderlands, GTA)
- `Sentiment`: Sentiment label — *Positive*, *Negative*, *Neutral*, or *Irrelevant*
- `Content`: The full tweet text

## ✅ Key Tasks Performed

- 🧩 Merged training and validation datasets into a single DataFrame  
- 🔍 Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Distribution of sentiments across the dataset  
  - Most frequently mentioned entities  
- 🧹 Cleaned and preprocessed tweet content:
  - Removed stopwords, punctuation, and irrelevant symbols  
  - Lowercased text and applied regex cleaning  
- 📊 Visualized insights using:
  - **Bar charts** for sentiment and entity distributions  
  - **Word clouds** for each sentiment category  
- 📈 Gained actionable insights on how different brands are perceived

## 📊 Visual Output Highlights

- **Sentiment Distribution Bar Chart**  
- **Top Entities by Frequency**  
- **WordClouds** by Sentiment (*Positive*, *Negative*, *Neutral*, *Irrelevant*)  
- **Tweet Content Preprocessing Workflow**
